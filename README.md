# WorldEditWatcher

> A simple plugin to alert admins when users are using WorldEdit commands.

This is a very simple plugin requested by @ACA30 so that admins can be notified when a user uses a WorldEdit command.

## Installation

Just grab the latest JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/WorldEditWatcher/releases).

## Usage

The two permissions needed are:

- `WorldEditWatcher.notify` - Sends you notifications when a user executes a WorldEdit command.
- `WorldEditWatcher.bypass` - Lets you bypass WorldEdit notifications so that not even admins get notified when you use WorldEdit commands.

Additionally, to use the `/worldeditwatcher` command, you will need `WorldEditWatcher.use`.
